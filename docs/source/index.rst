Welcome to FLOMPY's documentation!
==================================

What is FLOMPY?
---------------

The FLOod Mapping PYthon toolbox (FLOMPY) is a new fully automatic, free and open-source python toolbox
for mapping of floodwater.

How does it work?
-----------------

FLOMPY exploits the dense Sentinel-1 GRD intensity time series and is based
on four processing steps. In the first step, a selection of Sentinel-1 images related to pre-flood
(baseline) state and flood state is performed. In the second step, the preprocessing of the selected
images is performed in order to create a co-registered stack with all the pre-flood and flood images.
In the third step, a statistical temporal analysis is performed and a t-score map that represents the
changes due to flood event is calculated. Finally, in the fourth step, a multi-scale iterative thresholding
algorithm based on t-score map is performed to extract the final flood map. We believe that the end-user community
can benefit by exploiting the FLompy flood maps.
