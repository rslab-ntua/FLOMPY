## Introduction

The FLOod Mapping PYthon toolbox is a free and open-source python toolbox for mapping of floodwater. It exploits the dense Sentinel-1 GRD intensity time series and is based on four processing steps. In the first step, a selection of Sentinel-1 images related to pre-flood (baseline) state and flood state is performed. In the second step, the preprocessing of the selected images is performed in order to create a co-registered stack with all the pre-flood and flood images. In the third step, a statistical temporal analysis is performed and a t-score map that represents the changes due to flood event is calculated. Finally, in the fourth step, a multi-scale iterative thresholding algorithm based on t-score map is performed to extract the final flood map. We believe that the end-user community can benefit by exploiting the FLOMPY's floodwater maps.

## 1. Installation

The installation notes below are tested only on Linux. Recommended minimum setup: Python 3.6, SNAP 8.0

### 1.1 Create python environment 
FLOMPY is written in Python3 and relies on several Python modules, check the file [FLOMPY_0.2_env.yml](https://github.com/kleok/FLOMPY/blob/main/docs/FLOMPY_0.2_env.yml) for details. We recommend using conda to install the python environment and the prerequisite packages, because of the convenient management.

### 1.2 Install snap gpt including [Sentinel-1 toolbox](https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/)

### 1.3 Account setup for downloading Sentinel-1 acquisitions
Sentinel-1 data download functionality require user credentials. More information [here](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)

### 1.4 Account setup for downloading global atmospheric model data
ERA-5 data set is redistributed over the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), create a new account on the CDS website if you don't own a user account yet. On the profile, you will find your user id (UID) and your personal API Key. Create a file .cdsapirc under your home directory and add the following information:
```
url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2
key: UID:personal API Key
```
CDS API is needed to auto-download ERA5 ECMWF data: conda install -c conda-forge cdsapi
More details on CDSAPI can be found [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to).

### 1.5 Download FLOMPY
git clone https://github.com/kleok/FLOMPY.git

on GNU/Linux, append to .bashrc file:
```
export FLOMPY_HOME=~/FLOMPY
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${FLOMPY_HOME}
export PATH=${PATH}:${FLOMPY_HOME}
```
## 2. Running Flompy
[FLOMPYapp.py]("https://github.com/kleok/FLOMPY/blob/main/FLOMPYapp.py")

FLOMPY generates a floodwater map based on Sentinel-1 GRD products and meteorological data. FLOMPYapp.py includes the functionalities for FLOMPY's routine processing for generating floodwater maps. User should provide the following information at configuration file FLOMPYapp_template.cfg
```
